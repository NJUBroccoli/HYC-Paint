# HYC-Paint

A painting tool developed with Java and it can draw lines, polygons, ellipses, curves and do some geometric transformation to them. It is Broccoli's course assignment for Computer Graphics in Nanjing University. It will be developing until late June. Code-level plagiarism is not allowed while ideas' borrowing is allowed.

## Environment Configuration

`JDK8/Java8` and newer versions are enough, since `JavaFX` has been included in them.

## How to compile and run?

- You can open the project in `Intellij IDEA` and run `Main`.
- A shell bash `run.sh` is provided so you can type `$ bash run.sh` to compile and run it. At current stage, two CLI parameters are needed, representing the path of input file and the path of image output directory. For example, 

    ```
    $ bash run.sh input.txt ./ -f
    ```
- You can also launch a python-like CLI by

	```
	$ bash run.sh input.txt ./ -c
	```

## Front End

At current stage, the GUI of HYC-Paint has not been developed so only CLI is supported. You can input instructions into your input file (designated by you). The following instructions are a good example. The annotations beginning with `%` should not appear in real files.

```
resetCanvas 400 300     % Clear and reset the canvas to 400 * 300

saveCanvas output.bmp       % Save the canvas to output file [Ouput_dir + output.bmp]
exit       % Exit

```

- `JavaFX` is being used to optimize the front-end.

## Back End

In addition to the classes used for the project architecture, `CGAlgorithm.java` Encapsulates algorithms for generating various graphic entities.
